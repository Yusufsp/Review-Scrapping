"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black","Great value, no headphone jack",4.0,"I bought this to be a lightweight headphone set for my daughter's birthday a few months back, and it has been with us for long enough that I feel happy to review it.If you want a reliable headset from a known brand at a good price, then this is an excellent contender. It has been well designed for rough handling and abuse without feeling too cheap. The money saved appears to have been used on decent enough drivers and good battery life. These are small, good for kids and travelling, but if you want to be insulated from the world the ear cups go on your ears, not over them.Pros:•Lightweight•Durable•Good sound production•Charges via USB C•Long battery life•Fairly Comfortable•Seems to cancel noise adequately•Budget design means cheap materials, excellent for a headset that is likely to be abusedCons:•No headphone jack•Cannot connect whilst charging•Small ear cups that don't seal around your ears•Budget design means cheap materials, the headset feels plasticy to handle"
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Bluetooth,5.0,Easy to set up on Bluetooth (having read the instructions first)lasts a good while on build in rechargeable battery also. seem ok so far.
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Very pleased,5.0,"Due to an injury I have been sleeping on the couch, more comfortable than a bed. I bought these to watch TV when every one else has gone to bed. Very good."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",High Quality and Durable,5.0,I bought these to wear to work as a gardener. The sound quality is very good and it’s easy to control the volume using the buttons on the side. The noise cancellation is of a high quality under normal circumstances but when it comes to using power tools it didn’t help much. They suffered a fair bit of wear and tear from the outside work but they work incredibly well and seem to be very durable. Very good value for money!
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Lasted 11 months.,5.0,"These headphones were great, used them daily for 11 months and then just recently the flimsy plastic SNAPPED leaving one of the ears hanging on by the wire…they are good value for money but the plastic is very cheap so just be careful !!"
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Great for the price.,5.0,"What can I say? For the price these headphones are great! These are my 1st Bluetooth headphones I have owned.Obviously, they are not going to sound as good as high end headphones but for £35 the sound is still good. Other reviews mentioned that they wasn't  loud and the sound was low? I personally haven't had this problem. I used them for around an hour a day for the 1st 9 days and they were still fully charged.Unlike some reviews I find these to be a comfortable wear.A steal at the price. I would highly recommend."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Awesomely Good.,5.0,"Strong battery, Good sound quality!, Money worthy!.

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black","Really, really good, but not life changing.",4.0,"They work and look great, just not the revolution in bass i was hoping for. i guess i would need to pay more for that! great for running with at the gym. Battery life like most things is good at the start. who knows what will happen after a year or 2. paired with bluetooth to my android phone without any issues.Prime member purchase.Positive experience.Arrived in good condition.As described. Same as in picture.Arrived on time.Packaging was good.Works as expected.Recommended."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Great headphones for the price,5.0,"I've charged them once so far and they're still fully charged after hours or walking around in them, going to the gym etc. The sound is good and they get quite loud if needed. I can't seem to get them to work properly for calls and it always plays the sound of my mic back to me too, but that's probably something I'm doing 😅"
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black","Great sound, very light, long battery life",5.0,"I bought this to replace my Sony MDRIF140K infra-red headphones that I bought about a decade ago; they started to have some electrical problems (not surprising after so long). I was looking for something nice and light (the old ones were 125g); these ones are of a similar weight (132g). The Bluetooth range is very good (I also bought the Bluetooth adapter suggested as a bundle, TP-Link Nano USB Bluetooth 4.0 Adapter), which is an advantage over the old IR technology.The sound quality is excellent -- great frequency response and noise free. I had tried various wireless headphones and these have the best sound quality by far. They compare favourably with my Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 wired headphones. The on-ear pads block out a lot of ambient noise (possibly even a little too much -- you need to remove them to hear someone speak who is in the room).The rechargeable battery lasts a long time; I usually keep it turned on most of the day, even when not using them, and a full charge lasts a few days. I had to buy a longer charging cable since the included one is very short. But I use this long cable to also charge my new iPad mini, which also uses USB C.My major complaint is that the headphones are a little tight on my head, particularly since I wear glasses. The old Sony IR headphones were a lot more comfortable.I have used these on Zoom calls and they are very good for that, particularly since they are not very big so they do not look too goofy. I have not used the in-built microphone since I always use an external mic.All in all, I will give these headphones 5 stars, though I would actually have given them 4.5 stars if I could, marking them down a bit for being too tight for long-term use. Given the low price (I paid £35), I think they are excellent value."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",I LOVE THESE,5.0,They sound so good!! Battery lasts so long - I’ve had these for about a month now and I haven’t charged them since getting them (I use them everyday on the way to school) It blocks out the noice really well!
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",The best headphones ever,5.0,They are the best headphones for when your on a plane
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Amazing headphones but not so ergonomic,3.0,"They provide really good sound quality but I find that after wearing them for a few hours with no breaks, my neck starts to hurt as well as the top of my head. There is no noise cancelling feature which I don't really mind but you might need to look out for that. Also when connected to my iPhone 12 mini through Bluetooth, sometimes the microphone does not work during an incoming call, which is a bit annoying.Cool headphones though I think you should buy it for the aesthetic!!!"
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black","good headphone bad delivery, took 7 days and it made me pair next day delivery with no choice",4.0,"good headphone bad delivery, driver also left it in a plant loot in the open 🫣"
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Value for money. Great output,5.0,Value for money. Great output.  Only complaint if at all is the range - cuts out and back in while away from fixed device.  Absolutely enjoy the output from thiis product.  Simple hookup to bluetooth commection.  All this for under 40 quid!
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Good sound quality,5.0,Excellent bit of kit and good price
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Perfect for night time movies,5.0,"I wear these headphones for watching movies at night.I like that they tell you the remaining battery charge when you turn them on.I don't know how long they last in all honesty, but I wear them a couple of hours a night and hardly ever seem to charge them.I charge them using my phone charger as they both use USB c.  They charge quickly and have an indicator light.They are easy to pair, just hold the button for a few seconds.They are comfy to wear and I think the sound is good. I sometimes listen to music but I mainly wear them for watching movies.  I would definitely recommend these, in fact I have.They have made watching movies a lot more enjoyable."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Great wireless headphones on a budget,5.0,"Would recommend these headphones if you’re looking for something wireless. For me, they’re comfy enough but a tiny bit pinchy (as a glasses wearer and I have lots of ear piercings).The battery on these things is AMAZING, I’ve only charged them once since purchase so they would be great for travelling / long journeys.I don’t use the buttons on them to change songs or volume out of habit but they are easy enough to use.Overall, great for the price but if you want something more comfortable or cushiony I would recommend the more expensive Sony headphones."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Excellent quality at reasonable price,5.0,Excellent product very happy
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Microphone bad,4.0,"The microphone is very sensitive and therefore picks up the sound of wind and everything around you, you can also hear everything the microphone is playing into your ear."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",cheap quality,3.0,"in terms of sound quality the product was excellent for its price, however the outer plastic shell of the headphones felt very flimsy and not durable if it were to fall."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Good Phones,4.0,"Good phones.  Easy to set up and use, comes pre charged."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Great sound for a low price,4.0,"These headphones are a great entry level set when it comes to sound and punchy bass. A long battery life is what made the difference in the 2 sets I was considering and the 30ish hour playtime claim holds up well. Although fairly compact and light in design, the build quality feels very cheap and I would not personally have confidence that they would survive a head height fall outdoors.Low cost, long life and great for use around the home."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Sidetone Ruins Them,1.0,"Do you want to hear yourself/wind/traffic louder than the person you're talking to on the phone? Do you want the person you're talking to to constantly hear themselves?THEN DO I HAVE THE HEADPHONES FOR YOU!These are midlingly comfortable with a respectable battery, and fairly decent sound if you're listening to music.However, these all fade into insignificance when you decide you want to call someone or otherwise use the microphone, because for some bafflingly insane reason, Sony decided that the microphone should be wired into the speakers, meaning you can constantly hear yoursef and your surroundings when on a call. And you can't turn it off.This is genuinely the most bafflingly stupid design decision in Sony's history. I can think of not a single reason why this was implemented, or whose life has been improved by said implimentation.It's like buying a car where the windscreen retracts at speeds above 30.Sony, have a word with yourself. Something you're able to do handily when using these damned things."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Amazing headphones!!,5.0,"Very good headphones, light, easily portable, however don't feel very secure on your head so wouldn't recommend if wanting them for running etc (however they are fine for walking)"

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Met all my expectations.  Very fast delivery.,5.0,"I watched a couple of movies with these headphones, the quality was excellent. I met my expectations.  Also, it did not take long to receive them."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Cheap and cheerful. Uncomfortable. Bass heavy. Problematic pairing. Not recommended.,2.0,"I know these are budget headphones but they are very cheaply built being very lightweight and entirely plastic. Annoyingly Sony have saved pence by not putting any padding on the head band which makes it very uncomfortable especially as there are two hard plastic ridges that run across the inside of the head band. Even after 10 minutes I'd had enough and my head was still sore an hour later. Fortunately this was easily remedied with a short length of adhesive weather stripping. But how ridiculous that I have to do that in the first place.Another negative point is that it took me the best part of an hour to get them to pair with my Samsung phone. I eventually found some help by googling the problem and found that the set had not been left in the correct state after it had left the factory and so had to be re-initialised (with the set in the off state, simultaneously hold down the power and the - volume button for 7 seconds). Easy enough to do once you know how. Incidentally, the instructions you receive with the product are next to useless and impossibly small to read.The sound, like many modern headsets, is bass heavy. I don't mind too much as I'm a bass player and it actually helps when working out bass lines. If you prefer a neutral sounding headphone then these probably aren't suitable.I have at last got a product that suits my needs and is now reasonably comfortable to wear but I really can't recommend them for all the negative reasons that I've mentioned. I expected better from Sony."

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black","Good headphone, but could do with some improvements",4.0,"This is a really good set of headphones with a very good sound quality. I mostly use these for meetings in Teams and so far I am happy with them. There are some issues with these, mostly down to my personal preference however.There has been some occasions where I have lost sound in Teams during meetings, but I can fix this if I flip between the laptop speaker and then back to he Sony Headphone hands free. Not sure yet why this is happening but it could be originating from the laptop and not the speakers.The biggest issue I have is the Sidetone feature. This allows to hear yourself when speaking during a meeting, and apparently is a feature that cannot be adjusted or even disabled. Sony sees this a good feature, but I would somehow disagree, as it could be annoying and disruptive, and takes some time to get use to it.I must say, event though I love these headphones, this Sidetone issue, does not make these headphones perfect in my view. Still however, I have kept them :)"

Just a pity they don't fold all the way , would have been better but not a huge issue . Started off uncomfortable but after a while I did get used to them and barely notice ."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Simple BT headphones,3.0,"I don't know why Amazon asks to rate Noise Cancellation features, these are not NC headphones.They are simple and light BT headphones. Pairing is quick and reliable, on startup they announce battery level, so you can charge before they get flat. Power is USB-C connector.The downside to these headphones is the headband. It's rather uncomfortable, without any padding and leaves marks on the head in as little as 30 minutes (if you're bald and don't have padding , like me).As on-ear headphones, they naturally press on the ear, I find it contrast to other headphones like the AKG Y50 (at double the price) rather uncomfortable. Wearing them gets warm, and where they press against the helix (outtermost structure of the concha) it gets really uncomfortable after a couple of hours, especially if you're wearing glasses.I've had them for three months, so can't say how long they will last, I suspect the hard plastic frame will give out from simple mechanical force such as being packed in a suitcase sooner or later.tl;dr: good sound the price, but comfort some comfort issues."

No breakage yet though 👍🏻"
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Great for the price,5.0,"I wanted headphones that weren’t too expensive. These are great for the price. They are loud and stay on my head when working out. The best thing about them is the battery life, I’ve had them for about 3 months and only charged once or twice and I use them for about 6-7 hours a week."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black","Decent sound, decent bluetooth, shame about noise cancellation and comfort",4.0,"I find these headphones to be rather confusing. I bought these to use with my Iphone as I have my whole library of MP3's saved onto the phone. These headphones produce decent sound, bluetooth connectivity can also be quite good although I have experienced a couple of cut outs from this device a few times.I find these to be ever so slightly louder than the previous version (WH-CH500) but at the same time less warm sounding whilst the bass tends to be a little more in your face. The CH500's I feel produced a better sounding package overall but considering the price these also do a decent job.One area where these fall down compared to the previous version is comfort. After a while of use, these tend to hurt quite a bit on the ear. It usually happens around 30 minutes after putting them on. With the CH500's I did not feel this was as bad. I could wear those for far longer before feeling any pain in my ears!Overall, a great sounding pair of headphones, just shame about the comfort."

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Great indoors but poor outdoors,4.0,"I bought on-ear headphones rather than noise cancelling headphones because I got them for wearing while in the street, and didn't want to be too cut-off from my surroundings. However as soon as there's any traffic noise you can hardly hear anything through them. I actually prefer using my Sony MDR-XB50AP in-ear headphones because the sound quality is better! I've tried them with different styles of music and the sound quality is generally very good although a bit lacking in the bass where there's a heavy drum beat, but the connectivity is excellent and they're good for a small head."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Reasonably Good for the price.,4.0,I live about 30 miles from my son but with these headphones connected to our iPhones via Bluetooth my son and I can use WhatsApp over Wi-fi to talk whilst we ride together on Zwift.Had reservations about the microphone being integral to one of the earphones but need not have worried as it picks up everything.Comfortable enough for an hour or so.Sound quality when listening to music better than I expected for the price.They don’t fall off while I’m riding and neither do I.
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Feels cheap and average sound quality,4.0,"Given the positive reviews on these headphones, specially on its sound quality, i decided to buy these, apart from most of the reviews pointing to how cheap they look. For me the sound quality is more important and i would be using them most of the time indoor, so poor noise cancellation wouldn't be such a problem. The sounds didn't impress me, i feel they lack high frequencies, and consequently clarity. Bass is ok, however it emphasizes the mid  low frequency bass, instead of the really low. I was expecting better sound quality to be honest, specially from Sony. Not sure of its because its a bluetooth pair of headphones, but that shouldn't make any difference as soon as bluetooth bandwidth is enough. I always choose sony headphones because they usually have very good sounds quality, at least for my taste. I didn't feel  the same about these ones unfortunately. Lets see how long they last."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Good Product - Big Head friendly - Worth it!,5.0,"I use this headset for work meetings.Pros -1. Good battery life, only need to charge it once in about 3 days, with about 4 or 5 hours of being on call everyday.2. Good microphone, my colleagues can hear me well and do not hear too much of background noise at my end (which can sometimes include the TV for my kid on at a moderately low volume).3. Good enough range that I can step away from computer and get a cup of tea from the kitchen4. (Deal clincher for me) - Good for big heads. At max stretch it is 55cm ear to ear; when not expanded it is 47cm. 5. Does not hurt my ears.6. Good price, a third of the equivalent JabraCons -- Not really cons for me, but just some notes1. Not noise cancelling2. Does not have the microphone wand, if you like that in a headset. It is built into the ear piece."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Fab! But keep in mind..,4.0,"Fab! But keep in mind that there is no aux cable or aux plug-in spot for the headphones. If you can use Bluetooth this is absolutely fabulous and the sound is amazing. I can tell these headphones are going to live a long life. We have had many failing headphones, and we hope Sony can make that change with these ones. The last ones I bought were a solid £20, in Curry's Pc world, and we thought they were amazing and perfect, but after just a few months, they broke. Even after we tried repairing them, they broke EVEN MORE. I hope these ones will do the job, so far, so good!"

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Good for the price.,4.0,"Had these for about 3 weeks now and I'd definitely say they are good value. Wouldn't recommend for children or those with smaller heads as it won't adjust as much, perfect for bigger heads/hat wearers.- Noise cancellation isn't great on loud volumes.- Feels quite plasticy but is durable.- Battery is awesome, haven't had to charge it yet but I don't use it too much.- Connects easily to Macbook and mobile phone.- Not foldable unfortunately.- Sound signature didn't have as much... Depth? I'm not sure of the word but my old sony wired pair sound nicer.Overall good for the price, music sounds ok not the best but I've gotten used to it. Would still recommend for those on a budget."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Love these headphones for the price,4.0,"A generally good budget pair of headphones (I also got them on offer) that have decent sound and keep their charge for a good period of time (with a few hrs listening a day mine lasted over a week on a full charge). The Bluetooth signal is strong and gets through walls my old ones didn't. However they, as is often the case with Bluetooth, are a bit unreliable at connecting to the correct device at the correct time - which can be a bit annoying. I also would only buy them for listening. Although they have a mic and I have tried them for calls, I found them very 'echoy' compared to my other Bluetooth headphones. But for music or audiobooks fantastic!"

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Love them!,5.0,"Great headset, exactly what I was looking for. I use it mostly to listed to a podcasts while working, sometimes a bit of music. The sound quality and sound insulation might not be 100%, but it is good enough for me (I’m no specialist). I love the fact that as a glass wearer they don’t squeeze my glasses into my skull around the ears plus I can pivot the actual cushiony bit so it further releases the pressure. The battery is amazing also! Great item for the price. The only thing that isn’t too great is that it seems that I need to get one device to ‘forget’ the headset to connect it to a different one, but as I mentioned, for the price that isn’t that big of a deal for me."

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Great for the price,4.0,I was after a pair of under £50 wireless headphones for listing to podcasts and music on during my commute and came across these on Amazon. Reviews were alright and I trust Sony gear.I’m really pleased with them for £30. The battery life is amazing and I only needed to charge them after two weeks after using them for about 22hrs a day.I give them 4 stars as the sound quality is only average but to be fair I didn’t expect more for the price. I’ve had AKGs previously and their sound quality is brilliant. They also don’t cancel noise at all but then again they don’t claim to and sometimes I think it’s better to hear your surroundings when you’re walking around London!Great buy for the price and I’ll get loads of use out of them.
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Entry level Bluetooth headphones that have done it right,4.0,"Sound quality is not something to boast here, but these headphones still provide good fidelity. What matters more for me is that there is no hissing and no white noise, which is much appreciated. Bluetooth signal stability is also satisfactory; I experienced no dropouts or hiccups. As this is a pair of on-ear headphones, there is virtually no noise cancellation, but this is conscious choice from me because I'm using them at home, not during traveling or work; I need to hear what's going on around the house. Headset itself is not too tight; do have this in mind if using while exercising. Build quality is slightly flimsy, so I would be gentle with them. While it may seem that this product is not perfect in all regards, it gets the job done: a pair of reliable wireless headphones that are within budget."

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Not really for what we wanted,3.0,"I bought these headphones because my husband had seen them highly recommended on a TV programme. However he wanted them to listen to the TV and it seems they were not really intended for that. Our son in law connected them via blue tooth to the TV and they worked beautifully, but when my husband wanted to  connect the following day, my son in law had to reconnect them. With his old headphones we used to do it every day, as it was just a question of pressing a button on the headphones and then pressing one button on the TV headset to select 'yes'. This was too involved for us to do every time he wanted to watch TV, so our son in law bought us some that worked in the same way as our previous ones."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Decent pair of mid range bluetooth headphones,4.0,"I've been using these to listen to podcasts on my daily walks and whilst doing household chores. Bluetooth connection is great and easy to use, especially in winter when you're wearing three extra layers of clothing and headphone wires are just another thing to get in the way. I do find they pinch my ears, although admittedly my head is quite big and I have a lot of hair for them to get round."

My advice, if looking for noises cancelling, the price will be above 75£ to get something decent  otherwise, get these ones.Update on the review:Start having connectivity and volum issues after few months of normal use.Good luck 👍"
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Good headphones for the price you pay.,4.0,"After 1 week using: Bought for 34 (cyber Monday) I can absolutely say that the price is very good for what you have in hands then. Audio quality is good, I'd prefer more realistic bass, this headphones has bass but it's kind of pumped (bass with makeup), compared to a pair of more expensive AKG (wired), but for 34£ and via Bluetooth it's ok. Mid and high range frequency good, nothing bad to say. Comfort enough good for the price. Battery (first week) very long duration. Isolation medium, at half volume, if you put the headphones on a table while music playing, you can hear it, so the same form out to your ear, but there's a bit of isolation. You can understand the real audio quality of this headphones in a quiet room, not on a bus.I'm happy about this purchase."

That good is battery life.2. Audio quality is reasonably good.3. Wireless Bluetooth connects to your device ‘automatically’ after once configured.4. There is no noise cancelling (which I never needed anyway)5. Charging cable is very short. It would be better if it was a bit longer.

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",WRONG CHARGER,3.0,The headphones are generally good but when I went to charge them up they were for the wrong charger ;-;
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Good all round. But not amazing.,4.0,"Just a short review for any potential buyers that are unsure.Generally I’m happy with these headphones, but wish I had the patience to shop round.The look is smart and clean, with a textured finish which works for me as I mainly use them in a gym. However they do feel cheap. An all plastic finish and the ear pieces are loose and moves easily, almost too easily.They have a good fit and are snug. I’d imagine they would eventually get warm on the ears as they’re on-ear rather than over-ear.Sound quality is average. I’ve have marked them at £30-40 headphones. Good amount of bass but not particularly crisp mid and high ends. £50 seems steep. I was slightly underwhelmed - but contradictorily I’m sure I’ll like them and put them through their paces."

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black","Great for the money, but has drawbacks",4.0,"I think these headphones are great for the money. Only problem I have is the head strap is just raw plastic without any padding or not slip material. Perhaps this what you get for under £40, but this lack of friction means the weight of headphones causes them to fall off my head when I lean forward. So they have to be constantly adjusted when leaning forward which is irritating, and kinda defeats the object of having a head strap to keep them on your head.  Fine if you are sitting still not doing anything, but not good if you are doing anything more exciting. I am now going to modify them with some tape or not slip material on the head strap."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Excellent value,5.0,"These are a great pair of wireless headphones.The sound quality is very good for the price.  Bass is weighty, treble is nice and clear.  They go up to a respectable volume.Comfort wise they're not the best I've worn, however they don't cause any aches or sore spots and are very lightweight.  I wore them for 14 hours straight and didn't notice any discomfort.The battery life is impressive. I can get 20+ hours use, at high volumes, before needing a recharge.  They boast up to 32 hrs play back, and I don't doubt these headphones could achieve that.They charge quickly, I've not timed it exactly, but half an hours charge will last you a good 8 hours, at least.These are rather good for the £35 I paid, which is why they get a deserved 5 stars, even though the sub categories score 4 stars a roos the board."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Alright for the price,4.0,Background noise is too loud and clear for both parties when on a call which is a bit off putting

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Uncomfortable head strap and terrible microphone feedback mar what could have been a good product,1.0,"I don't know what I was expecting from this headset, I didn't expect audiophile sound, or premium build quality, but I wasn't expecting an unpadded hard plastic head strap that digs into my head, is uncomfortable within a minute and unbearable within 10!I ended up wrapping the headset strap in bubble wrap until a third party strap cover arrived, and that was another tenner I shouldn't have had to budget for.Sound quality as headphones is Ok, about what I'd expect at this price point, but the microphone has incredibly irritating feedback. I wasn't expecting it it to be as good a noise cancelling headset, but the microphone picks up the headphone output, which it echoes back a fraction of a second later, causing a feedback loop. This makes it sound like you're in a cave as soon as you switch from headphone to headset mode.I wanted on-ear headphones as my ears over heat in over-ear headphones, but these clamp with enough force that even the soft leatherette pad start to get hot and uncomfortable after not too long.Charging is also irritating. It tells you how much charge is left when you turn it on, which is useful if it's low, but it would be more useful for it to tell you the charge when you turn it off. Since you can't use this headset while charging, it would be useful to know that it's worth putting them on to charge while you don't need to use them, rather than only finding out you need to charge them when you do want to use them.Overall these were very disappointing given the well respected brand. They were obviously made to a price point, but some of these problems would be so easy to fix. A few pennies for strap padding, a few more for a microphone jack port, a few more for a power management IC which allowed use while charging, these could have rounded off the worst rough edges of this product."

I am now a convert having grown to understand the principle.  It works very well to help you understand just how loud you are on the phone! When not using them as a headset, i have found them to be superbly musical with a detailed, open soundstage and suprisingly even frequency profile and unfatigueing to listen to.  In a nutshell, learn to use the sidetone: your family and friends will appreciate it when you've got the hang of it and you get a suprisingly good pair of headphones as well."

I go for a 1 hour walk everyday wearing these & never had ear aches or any pains. There not to tight or to loose. Not too big. I wouldn’t want a pair of large cans out & about. I definitely wouldn’t want a pair of moronic looking sucker Beats headphones. These are subtle.I tried several budget in ear headphones under £70 & they were all disappointing. Uncomfortable & impractical.These are by quite a margin the best value & most practical.They sound good too. Balanced bass, mids & treble.

They are also very light and comfortable to wear.  However, I have to keep pairing these every time I want to use them.  I use them with my television and once paired and connected, the TV shows them in the list of paired audio devices.  However, the next time I use them, after switching them on, the TV detects them and asks me if I want to use the headphones, so I click on yes to allow them to be used.  They connect ok, but after a couple of seconds they bleep and the headphones say ""pairing"", but nothing happens.  To get them working I have to remove them from the list of paired devices, re-pair them and then connect again.

My only problem with these is that it can be quite a hassle switching them from one device to another as you have to impair then then pair them to the new device. This can be quite annoying if you are doing this fairly often. Other that this they are very good headphones

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Unuseable for Calls,1.0,"As soon as you start a call the headphone turns on SideTone, a stupid/crappy feature that feeds a laggy and high volume feed of the sounds in your surroundings directly into you ears. ANY sound in your surroundings is pumped high volume into your head and distracts you from actually hearing what’s being said in the call, my own keyboard and mouse clicks sound like they are inside my head, horrible. The worst part is that you cannot turn sidetone off, can’t imagine who had the Genius idea to ruin an otherwise solid product."

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Satisfied…………,4.0,"……..with the little time required for the headphone to be fully charged and with how long it lasts once charged.  The battery level indicator is useful – fully charged, 70%, 50%, battery level low; not all headphones have this.  Sound leakage starts to become noticeable above medium volume. For me, medium volume is loud enough; so that is not a problem. It connects quickly to devices and feels comfortable in comparison with over-padded headphones. A short USB type A to USB type C cable is supplied with it, which means that the headphone cannot be charged with the more common cables."

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Excellent headphones - great price,5.0,These are about the fifth set of headphones my 19 year old son has gone through in about a year. I’ve no idea what he does to them but they always end up with only one side working. He’s gone through cheap sets to expensive Beats headphones and they still all end up with one side working.These Sony headphones look good in black. They are not like the big chunky headphones you get and Sony are well known for their quality and one of the best brands for electronics.These headphones are bluetooth and wireless and the sound quality is very good for the price.

The bass is powerful and defined, and there is very minimal sound leakage. The only drawback is what seems to be very cheap plastic that the shell is made of. It makes it feel more second rate than it should. It also is on-ear, which may be a drawback to some for the discomfort it may bring"

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Sound OK. Microphone POOR.,2.0,"The sound quality is fine considering the price. The build quality is fine considering the price. The comfort levels are fine considering the price.The microphone is just utter rubbish when making phone or video calls.I don’t know what Sony is trying to achieve by making the microphone so sensitive.During a call, all you can hear is the echo of every sound that surrounds you.Other people on the call can hear more of the surronding sounds than the voice of who is speaking.During a work video call, while on mute, I could hear the echo of me tapping the keyboard and the echo sound of a printer at least 4 metres away.At first I thought it might be the sound settings on the laptop, but then tried it with a phone and a tablet and had exactly the same issues.I wasn’t expecting great quality based on price, but this is just not acceptable by a reputable company like Sony.Apparently this is caused by the Sidetone function, which cannot be disabled or adjusted.If you want the headphones to listen to music with above average sound quality, then these headphones are fine.If you want to use them for music as well as a wireless headset to make phone or video calls, I suggest you don’t buy these."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Last for 5-9 months - Bad Build Quality,2.0,"Ordered these on 06/08/2020 and they broke today on 29/05/2021, so they lasted for about 9 months, almost 10. I rotated the right headphone and the plastic connection between the headphone and the main stem fell apart, revealing the wire. They never indicated any sign of weakness before, it was just an unexpected failure.Otherwise, the headphones have good sound quality but obviously they are not the most sturdy headphones. The battery life is also pretty good, they can easily last a few days if you use them here and there.I had high hopes that these would last longer than the wired headphones of the past.  The battery life and sound quality save it but for the lack of sturdiness, I give 3 stars.Update on 12/08/2021, I returned the broken headphones to Amazon and got new ones under warrantyUpdate on 26/11/2021The new headphones have broken in the exact same way in less than 6 months. Only buy these if you are happy to use them for only a few months."

Fine for a podcast or something but for music I wouldn't recommend them at all. Odd because two friends suggested these but they really didn't live up to anything.

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Great headphones but they have one bad thing,5.0,So when you make a call using them even on PC you can hear your self which is so annoying and worse yet there is no way to disable that option because its designed to do that on purpose. I cant even begin to understand how stupid this is and why it even exist but other then this they are great headphones work well last long.

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Great Headphones for the Price,5.0,"I've been using these for a couple of months now—at the gym, during my commute, sometimes all day while I work. The battery life is fantastic, the sound quality is impressive for the price, and they are quite comfortable. They are on-ear, not around-ear, but more comfortable than most on-ear models I've tried in the past. They are obviously more cheaply made than other models, at first they feel almost too light-weight and flimsy. But over time I've discovered that to be an advantage, as they remain comfortable over long periods of time. The Bluetooth works well, connecting easily to my iPhone every time, and the buttons are easy to use and well-placed. I highly recommend these as a high-quality affordable option."

Decent sound quality.However, I got these to use for calls for work through zoom/skype etc and I can hear every sound (such as my voice, ambient noise) reflected back at me in a constant echo.After googling this apparently its a 'side tone feature' which you cannot disable. So they're basically unusable (unless you like hearing your own voice when you speak)"

( For some reason microfone redirect every sound to the headset speakers and I can hear every mouse click, keyboard  and even my breath and I didn't found a solution to fix this issue.)  And that make these headphones almost useless because I can't use them in voice chats, and interlocutor always complain for my microfone.+ Bluetooth connection is good, no objections.+ Battery life and charge is good, no objections."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",can hear all the background noises,2.0,"I needed a replacement headset to replace a broken cheaper headset I had.My main requirement for the headset was for online meetings, but I also wanted to use them to listen to videos and Music.I thought I go for a named brand this time and chose these Sony WH-CH510.My initial reaction when taking them out of the box was, they looked and felt cheap, however for the price I was going to overlook the aesthetics if the quality was okay.It was very easy to setup and my initial reaction to the quality of the sound whilst listening to a video was good.I was able to leave the room where I left my device and go into the kitchen, the quality was the same, so even going through two walls the Bluetooth seemed to be great.The main problem was when I was on a meeting, the microphone was picking up all the sounds, even when I was in another room, I could hear the door closing, dogs barking etc which was extremely distracting hence the reason for the low score."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Good sound quality. But feels cheap and uncomfortable.,3.0,So the sound quality isn't abysmal considering how cheap these headphones are. The frequencies are well defined but as the drivers are only small you're not going to be getting huge amounts of bass if that's your thing.However they do feel cheap and they certainly feel like it when you wear them as they have no padding in the headband. Not very comfortable to wear stationary and if you're moving a lot I imagine they'll feel worse. However I have a fairly large head so your opinion may differ. But as I mentioned there's no padding in the headband so I can see it being a common problem for most people.I'm happy with them as a quick solution to no longer having a headphone jack. But if I can find a more comfortable pair that offers similar if not better sound quality I'll jump on board.

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Side Tone sucks and should be a removable feature,1.0,I wish I did some more research before buying these headphones. They come with a feature called sony side tone which feeds the microphone input back into your ears...yes thats right! Not only does this headphone feed the microphone into your ears but it does this at the cost of audio qaulity and you cant disable it.basically it reduces your music level and inceases the microphone feedback so sounds from your surounding  sound even louder when you have the headphones on.On a train listening to music?Wrong! you are on a train listening to the sounds of people amplified in your ears with a slight undertone of musicin the office on zoom meeting?Wrong! you in the office listening to your keyboard clicks and the odd chair sound from 100m away with an undertone of the meetingI would rather listening to music through a dog turd.

Sound quality is fine, I actually mixed some music with it for fun and it did the job ok.Can get a little soar after about 6/8 hours or continuous use.Battery holds up fine. I'm getting at least 12-16 hours of user per charge. Charging it every 2 or 3 days. Charges quick enough. Would recommend."

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",No use for teams conference calls,2.0,Had bought these to give wireless ability on my pc for teams calls but they are no good for this. The mic appears to be always on and picking up a lot of background noise which you can hear through the headset while you talk and when not talking. I've returned them disappointed. Back to a wired set for now!
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Very good do recommend,4.0,Great sound quality good battery life better if they were padded on the top but worth buying

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Good battery and USB c charging for bargain price,4.0,Best things is battery life and USB c charging. Sound quality is little bit off so can't recommend for music but that can be depends on style you like find it great for movie's. Small driver's little bit tight on ear's but not painful or uncomfortable for few hours of wearing.

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Atrocious headphones,1.0,"Has an extremely annoying echo on the headphones. Cuts most other sound out also, just don't buy them"
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Good value,5.0,These are very reasonable in price and do exactly what I want. I wear them at the gym so sound quality is not important to me (and I doubt I would know if it was good anyway!) They are very comfortable.
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black","Output great, mic not so much",2.0,"So I mainly bought these for listening to music in the gym or on the bus. Sound quality is fantastic for what you pay for. Then I got a phonecall...... I could hear my own voice back through the speakers in a distorted demonic drone, they were that bad. My friend who called me thought that he'd got a direct line through to Satan. If you're buying these just as headphones, do it 100% if you want something with good audio input quality, probably just fart in a cup and throw it at someone. It would probably much less offensive."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",For the price - no complaints. 👍,3.0,"Excellent battery life, the sound is of a good quality but it’s never going to beat a higher spec/priced pair.

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Excellent value bluetooth headphone,4.0,"A budget bluetooth headphone with surprisingly good sound quality.Build quality does not feel premium at all, plasticky and a bit clunky. Comfort is fine, and they do a pretty good job of blocking out external noise. However, the sound quality is really very good for this price point. Also the bluetooth range is excellent, I can still pick up very good signal from other rooms."

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Good headphones - Short charging cable,4.0,"Very nice earphones that block out outside noise really well. They give good sound quality and comfort even if the headband feels fairly large on its smallest setting. One downside is that the USB charging cable is very short - 23cm long including connectors. Apart from that, I am happy with my purchase."

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Well worth the £30!,5.0,"These headphones are great if you want something simple to use for everyday wear. The battery is long lasting - I can go over a week without having to charge it (although, due to lockdown, I probably haven’t used them as much as I would otherwise). Sometimes they are a little uncomfortable and hurt the top of my ears, but that’s nothing a little shift of the headphones can’t sort. All in all, I’m very happy with the purchase, especially since this is my first time using headphones rather than earphones"
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Really good for the price,5.0,I got these a couple of days ago to replace my in‐ear earphones. I just wanted the cheapest pair of Sony wireless ones. I put them on not expecting much but the sound quality for £35 is much better than I was expecting. I'm no expert but these seem brilliant to my novice ears. I feel like I'm in the room with the musicians. I will never go back to earphones again.
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Comfortable Headset,5.0,I do use this headset for hours at a time (I love audiobooks). My only wrinkle is if I want to link this to multiple devices it really struggles with this so its best to just connect to one device at a time which is a shame but a minor thing really. The battery lasts for a long time I can use it all day and I do. Highly recommended.
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black","A great buy, the battery is amazing!!",5.0,"I upgraded to Bluetooth & was not disappointed, good sound, easy to use & comfy.I'm very impressed with the battery life, I use them for an hour in the morning & an hour in the evening on the train to & from work. I charged them up fully when they first arrived, I've had them a month & haven't had to re-charge them yet!!The noise reduction's not as good as my old pair of sonys but that's only when I listen to them on the platform of a busy train station so... all in all good value for money."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Awesome budget headphones,5.0,"This is my second set of these but for a good reason! They get used daily by a young teenager so they suffer a fair amount of abuse/carelessness and they've handled a full year of that so I'm happy to replace them with a new set of the same item. Considering the cost, a full year of pretty hard knocks is great, not to mention they look good, sound good and have amazing battery life."
"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Great for Running,5.0,"I purchased these for when I go out on a run and I can honestly say they’re probably the best ones I’ve had, prior to these I tried all different brands but none of them matched the audio quality and comfort that these offer, they sit well on your nuggen whilst you’re running with no movement at all.The battery life on them is great, I charged them to full when I first got them and they’re still going about 3 weeks later after 30 mins use every other day.Definitely worth trying them to see if they suit you."

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black","Easy to use, decent sound quality (to my ears anyway), good value",5.0,"I got these for listening to music and making calls whilst stuck at home during lockdown. They work really well, connect to bluetooth easily, tell you how much charge they have left and have pretty good sound.I'm not a huge music snob so I'm sure others could critique the sound but for me they've been perfectly ok and at the price they're asking for them seem good value.They also work well for making calls with no one complaining about the sound quality when I've been on teleconferences etc."

"Sony WH-CH510 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, 35 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charge, On-ear Style, Hands-Free Call, Voice Assistant - Black",Sidetone function problem,5.0,"The main problem is the Sidetone function that you cannot disable. It sends all the noise from the environment surrounding you back to you. Thus you hear everything including your voice twice. It is impossible to disable it. Thus, the mic is not useful at all.===I set the rating to 5 stars as this headphones are much better than others I tried recently with similar price."
